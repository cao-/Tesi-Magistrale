* How to numerically compute Q, $\varepsilon$ doesn't have to be too small.
* Comparison with $\Bm E$ and~$\Bm\alpha$ (and simply the native space norm).
* Different $\phi$ detect different regularities.
* Properties of the quantity~$\norm{\Bm Q}_1$, used to build the classifier.
* ``Problems'' at the boundary and possible solutions.
* Effect of noise in the data
